                     <h2>Edinburgh Capitals Ice Hockey</h2>
                     <p> In the spring semester of my junior year, I studied abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland, where I held the position of a sports marketing intern for the Edinburgh Capitals Elite Hockey Team. The Edinburgh Capitals are a Scottish ice hockey club, playing in the UK-wide Elite Ice Hockey League. 
                      I started the Caps' Student Army and subsequent Inaugural Caps' Student Night for local university students to come to a match at a discounted price, while also including a Scotch pie and pint voucher.
                      I was respoonsible for managaging 'Caps Student Army' social media accounts, marketing materials for the event, and helping the event run smoothly on match night.  
                      While the team is a professional level team, the organization also holds community outreach programs to develop the younger feeder teams. I design sponsor booklets, school program pamplets, and various hockey school and camp posters. My daily activities also included assisting my supervisors and other rink personnel with box office, raffle tickets, and fan interactions, merchandise, press releases and emails.
