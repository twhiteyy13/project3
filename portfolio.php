      <div class="info">
    <p> For my senior art class, part of developing our artist practice includes professional development. One element of this is our onlince presence - how can people see our art, understand our art, or maybe even buy our art. 
      We split up into pairs to each research a website platform that we may be able to use to create our new site. After the presentations, I decided I liked wix the best because it was easy to use and had editing options for desktop and mobile viewing. 
      I think this project lets me better bring my design side into play because I can easily put my ideas into action, instead of trying to figure out the detailed code to perform each element. I especially love the use of the different galleries, which made it easy to display my art and categorize them based on medium.

      <div class="info">
    <p> Writing for The Odyssey at Rochester is an internship I've held while at the University of Rochester. 
      I was responsible for write weekly articles and meeting strict deadlines, self editing prior to submission for Chief Editors revisions. I had to research topics and ideas for prospective articles, as well as brainstorm with peers. A big part of this experience was use of social media – I had to share articles for my own Chapter as well as other campus’ on multiple platforms including Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest), which promotes website traffic by using tags for SEO purposes. An important design element is finding stock photos appropriate for my article cover photo and also practiced editing with HTML code. The layout and readability of a blog post is just as important as the website design itself.

      <div class="info">
    <p> This version of my artist website above, was my way of experimenting with another template and customizing it for my needs. I liked the clean front landing page and it also had a long scrolling page, but I found this to be a pro and a con. I wanted my site to feel coherent, and not disjointed. I wanted the color scheme to match throughout, but most importantly, I wanted my art to be displayed in the best way possible. This project was a virtual sketch/draft of my artist portfolio, and it was good practice for a) using wix, b) practicing good design utilization and c) playing with colors, fonts, and background images.

      <div class="info">
    <p> After being the webmaster for Alpha Kappa Psi this past semester, and using wordpress, which was frustrating, I did not expect to enjoy using wordpress for this lab. It was challenging, but I had a lot better experience starting from scratch here, than maintaining an existing wordpress site. I was able to practice using plugins, like FakePress to generate fake content, a Contact Form, a calendar, etc. I altered some of the html and CSS in my activated theme. I also added a slider presentation on the home page.
